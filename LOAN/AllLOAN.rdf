		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The &apos;all&apos; ontology for LOAN is provided for convenience for FIBO users. This ontology does not add new assertions, but imports most of the Production (Released) ontologies that comprise the FIBO Foundations (FND), Business Entities (BE), Financial Business and Commerce (FBC), and Loans (LOAN) domains, excluding individuals for governments and jurisdictions, financial services, regulatory organizations and related registries, and reference individuals, as well as the LCC region-specific ontologies.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
